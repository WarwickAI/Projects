# Project 1: Improving a models performance without changing the model

This project focuses on teaching the skills used to improve the performance of a model such as data cleanup and preprocessing, feature extraction and transformation, and hyperparameter tuning. 

Skills to gain: 
- Data pre-processing (clean-up, normalization, data categorisation, handling missing values)
- Feature engineering and feature impact analysis
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Cross-validation techniques
