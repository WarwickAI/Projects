# **WAI102** Introduction to Neural Networks

WAI102 aims to introduce students to modern machine learning without
forgetting the fundamentals. Inspired by [Andrej Karpathy](https://karpathy.ai/)'s ["spelled-out intro to neural networks"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMj-3S1tku0)
tutorial, in WAI102 we will learn how neural networks work from first principles
by creating an automatic differentiation engine and implementing back-propagation.

Lastly, we'll translate our implementation into a [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) equivalent implementation,
developing a strong understanding of how modern machine learning frameworks work, and giving you the tools
to start training your own models or implementing your own architectures!
