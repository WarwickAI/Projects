# Welcome

This website is the home of the projects of Warwick AI,
the University of Warwick Artificial Intelligence Society.

This year projects are gonna be run as self contained notebooks for you to work through
either by yourself or in a group; with a focus on teaching the skills needed to embark
on any kind of AI project.

Overtime this site will be populated will all kinds of projects (the first several are listed in 'Current and Upcoming Projects') and whilst the current ones listed are very basic,
we hope to release more advanced ones in the future so stay tuned.

You can find out more about our projects on the sidebar or learn
more about our other initiatives at [warwick.ai](https://warwick.ai/).

If you have any feedback for any of the projects you take part in, feel
free to tell us using this form: https://forms.gle/ahA6YWU4Zxx6Eshb7
