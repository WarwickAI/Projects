# Project 2: Model Evaluation and Anomaly Detection

This project focuses on learning how to evaluate a model when working with an imbalanced dataset on an anomaly detection problem.

Skills to gain:
- Anomaly detection
- working with imbalanced datasets
- precision-recall analysis
- model evaluation metrics (accuracy, F1-score, AUC).

Dataset: To be released

Notebook: To be released
